# Individualistic humans

;; This is adapted from `settlement.txt` to flow food from agriculture to adjacent
;; houses and camps. People in houses get first takings. Once the food has been 
;; taken, no-one gives anything to anyone else.

;; water produces food (fish, shellfish).
if state is water then food should be food + 2
flow 66% food from pasture to each house
flow 33% food from pasture to each camp

;; nomads make their first significant camp near water because of fish and
;; shellfish (kitchen-midden people)
if state is in grassland or heath and more than 3 neighbours are water and generation is more than 20 then state should be camp

;; sooner or later nomads learn to keep flocks
if state is in grassland or heath and some neighbours are camp then 1 chance in 2 state should be pasture

;; and more herds support more people
if state is in grassland or heath and more than 2 neighbours are pasture then 1 chance in 3 state should be camp
if state is pasture and more than 3 neighbours are pasture and fewer than 1 neighbours are camp and fewer than 1 neighbours within 2 are house then state should be camp

;; the idea of agriculture spreads
if state is in grassland or heath and some neighbours within 2 are house then state should be pasture

;; nomads don't move on while the have crops growing. That would be silly!
if state is camp and some neighbours are ploughland then state should be camp

;; Impoverished pasture can't be grazed permanently
if state is pasture and fertility is less than 2 then 1 chance in 3 state should be heath

;; nomads move on
if state is camp then 1 chance in 5 state should be waste
;; especially if hungry
if state is camp and food is less than 2 then state should be waste
;; nomads need to eat
if state is camp then food should be food - 2

;; pasture that's too far from a house or camp will be abandoned
if state is pasture and fewer than 1 neighbours within 3 are house and fewer than 1 neighbours within 2 are camp then state should be heath

;; markets spring up near settlements
if state is in grassland or pasture and more than 1 neighbours are house then 1 chance in 10 state should be market

;; good fertile pasture close to settlement will be ploughed for crops
if state is pasture and fertility is more than 10 and altitude is less than 100 and some neighbours are camp or some neighbours are house then state should be ploughland

;; pasture produces food in all seasons, but not much.
if state is pasture then food should be food + 2
flow 66% food from pasture to each house
flow 33% food from pasture to each camp

;; ploughland produces quite a lot of food.
if state is ploughland then food should be food + 16 and state should be crop

;; after the crop is harvested, the land is allowed to lie fallow. But cropping
;; depletes fertility.
if state is crop then state should be grassland and fertility should be fertility - 1

;; Houses benefit from adjacent crops. So do camps, but where there's conflict 
;; houses get first pickings.
flow 66% food from crop to each house
flow 33% food from crop to each camp

;; if there's reliable food available, nomads build permanent settlements
if state is camp and food is more than 10 then state should be house
;; people camp near to markets
if state is in waste or grassland and some neighbours are market then state should be camp

;; a market in a settlement survives
if state is market and some neighbours are inn then state should be market
if state is market then state should be grassland

;; a house near a market in a settlement will become an inn
if state is house and some neighbours are market and more than 1 neighbours are house then 1 chance in 5 state should be inn
;; but it will need some local custom to survive
if state is inn and fewer than 3 neighbours are house then state should be house

;; Households consume 2 units of food per season. If there isn't enough food
;; houses should be abandoned
;; resources from fishing
if state is house and more than 2 neighbours are water then food should be food - 2
;; from farming
if state is house and food is more than 4 and some neighbours are pasture then food should be food - 2
if state is house and some neighbours are ploughland then food should be food - 2
if state is house and some neighbours are crop then food should be food - 2
;; from the market
if state is house and some neighbours are market then state should be house

;; if householders are hungry they'll either starve or move on
if state is house and food is less than 4 then state should be abandoned
if state is abandoned then 1 chance in 5 state should be waste  


## Vegetation rules
;; rules which populate the world with plants

;; Occasionally, passing birds plant tree seeds into grassland 

if state is grassland then 1 chance in 10 state should be heath

;; heath below the treeline grows gradually into forest

if state is heath and altitude is less than 120 then state should be scrub 
if state is scrub then 1 chance in 5 state should be forest

;; Forest on fertile land grows to climax

if state is forest and fertility is more than 5 and altitude is less than 70 then state should be climax   
    
;; Climax forest occasionally catches fire (e.g. lightning strikes)

if state is climax then 1 chance in 500 state should be fire

;; Forest neighbouring fires is likely to catch fire. So are buildings.
if state is in forest or climax or camp or house or inn and some neighbours are fire then 1 chance in 3 state should be fire

;; Climax forest near to settlement may be cleared for timber
if state is in climax and more than 3 neighbours within 2 are house then state should be scrub

;; After fire we get waste

if state is fire then state should be waste

;; waste near settlement that is fertile becomes ploughland
if state is waste and fertility is more than 10 and some neighbours are house or some neighbours are camp then state should be ploughland

;; And after waste we get pioneer species; if there's a woodland seed
;; source, it's going to be heath, otherwise grassland.

if state is waste and some neighbours are scrub then state should be heath
if state is waste and some neighbours are forest then state should be heath
if state is waste and some neighbours are climax then state should be heath
if state is waste then state should be grassland


## Potential blockers

;; Forest increases soil fertility. 
if state is in forest or climax then fertility should be fertility + 1

## Initialisation rules

;; Rules which deal with state 'new' will waste less time if they're near the
;; end of the file

;; below the waterline we have water.

if state is new and altitude is less than 10 then state should be water

;; above the snowline we have snow.
if state is new and altitude is more than 200 then state should be snow

;; otherwise, we have grassland.
if state is new then state should be grassland
